# first-they-came-for

There's only so many times you can read Martin Niem√∂ller's 
["First they came"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...) poem
in Facebook memes before it begins to wear.  The version you've already 
heard uses usually three or four states of parallelism: Socialists,
the Trade Unionists, the Jews, and then possibly the sick.  It 
stands to reason that the more examples added, the higher the rhetorical
effect.  But that would mean taking the trouble to type them all out.
Clearly this is a job for software.

I will point out here that the rhetorical device of repeating the first
few words in every sentence is called **anaphora.**  In rhetoric, **symploce** is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is used successively at the beginning of two or more clauses or sentences and another word or phrase with a similar wording is used successively at the end of them. It is the combination of anaphora and epistrophe.   I point these facts out merely
to be pedantic for no reason.

The enclosed Python 3 script was developed by careful and detailed research of the 
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-occupied_Euraope#Occupied_countries) describing which
countries were occupied by Germany during World War II.  In total, I spent 
several minutes scanning the page and entering the descriptions of countries
into the script.

To run the script, run the script.
